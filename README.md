# ðŸ§® Solved Problems:


## ðŸ“Œ **Problem 1: Two Sum**

### **Description**
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, find two numbers in the array that add up to the target. Return their indices.  
- Each input is guaranteed to have exactly one solution.  
- You cannot use the same element twice.  
- Return the indices in any order.

### **Examples**
- **Input:** `nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9`  
  **Output:** `[0,1]`  
  **Explanation:** `nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9`.

- **Input:** `nums = [3,2,4], target = 6`  
  **Output:** `[1,2]`

- **Input:** `nums = [3,3], target = 6`  
  **Output:** `[0,1]`

## ðŸ“ˆ **Problem 2: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock**

### **Description**
Given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a stock on the `i`th day, maximize your profit by:  
1. Choosing a day to **buy** one stock.  
2. Choosing a different day in the future to **sell** that stock.  
3. Return the maximum profit. If no profit can be made, return `0`.

### **Examples**
- **Input:** `prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]`  
  **Output:** `5`  
  **Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (`price = 1`) and sell on day 5 (`price = 6`). Profit = `6 - 1 = 5`.

- **Input:** `prices = [7,6,4,3,1]`  
  **Output:** `0`  
  **Explanation:** No transactions are possible since prices only decrease.
